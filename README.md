# Amy Compiler

The aim of this project was to create a compiler for the Amy language, which is a simplified version of Scala. This was coded in Scala using the Scallion extension to create the lexer and parser. 

The code written is everything in the src folder and was done in collaboration with Justin Deschenaux. This goes above a simple Amy compiler as it also adds support for many string manipulations not natively supported by the language. A detail of what was added in this extension may be found in `report.pdf`.

In order to run the following, `sbt` is required.
